[Question]
已知 f(x) = 4x^3 - 9x - 14，求 f(2) 的值。

[The Start of Reference Answer]
f(2) = 0
[The End of Reference Answer]

[The Start of Assistant's Answer]
将 x=2 带入函数 f(x) 中，得到：

f(2) = 4 * (2)^3 - 9 * (2) - 14
     = 4 * 8 - 18 - 14
          = 32 - 18 - 14
               = 4
               
               所以，f(2) 的值为 4。
