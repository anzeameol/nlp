        "To find the area of a triangle given its three vertices, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by:\nArea = 1/2 * base * height\nwhere the base is any one side of the triangle and the height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that side.\nWe can choose any side as the base of the triangle, but let's take the side joining the vertices (0, 0) and (3, 3) as the base. To find the height of the triangle, we need to draw a perpendicular line from the vertex (3, 3) to the opposite side (0, 0).\nUsing the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line, we can find the equation of the side joining the vertices (0, 0) and (3, 3) as:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\nwhere m is the slope of the line and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\nSubstituting the values, we get:\ny - 0 = m(x - 0)\ny = mx\nSince the slope of this line is the same as the slope of the line joining the vertices (0, 0) and (3, 3), we can write:\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (3 - 0)/(3 - 0) = 1\nSo, the equation of the side joining the vertices (0, 0) and (3, 3) is:\ny = x\nNow, we need to find the equation of the perpendicular line from the vertex (3, 3) to the side (0, 0) to (3, 3). The slope of this line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the side, which is -1. Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny - 3 = -1(x - 3)\ny = -x + 6\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular line from the vertex (3, 3) to the side (0, 0) to (3, 3) is:\ny = -x + 6\nNext, we need to find the intersection point of these two lines, which will give us the height of the triangle. Solving the system of equations formed by the equations of the two lines, we get:\nx = 3, y = 3\nSo, the intersection point is (3, 3), which is also the third vertex of the triangle.\nNow, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\nArea = 1/2 * base * height\nwhere the base is the length of the side joining the vertices (0, 0) and (3, 3), which is sqrt(9 + 9) = 3sqrt(2), and the height is the distance between the third vertex (3, 3) and the base, which is 3 - 0 = 3.\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is:\nArea = 1/2 * 3sqrt(2) * 3 = 9sqrt(2)/2 units squared."

        "To find the probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 when rolling two dice, we need to count the number of outcomes in which this occurs and divide by the total number of possible outcomes.\nThere are 6 faces on each die, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\nTo get a total of at least 3, we can either roll a pair of 1s or a pair of 2s, or we can roll one 1 and one 2, or we can roll one 1 and one 3, and so on up to rolling two 6s.\nThe number of ways to roll a pair of 1s is 1, the number of ways to roll a pair of 2s is 1, the number of ways to roll a pair of 3s is 1, and so on up to the number of ways to roll a pair of 6s, which is 1.\nSo the number of outcomes in which we roll a total of at least 3 is 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 6.\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a total number that is at least 3 when rolling two dice is 6/36 = 1/6."

This is because 4 evenly divides into 2n."
