    "28": "The reference answer is incorrect. The area of the triangle is not 3, as stated. \n\nThe assistant correctly uses the distance formula to find the lengths of each side of the triangle. \n\nThe distance from (0, 0) to (-1, 1) is indeed √2, as calculated correctly by the assistant. \n\nThe distance from (0, 0) to (3, 3) is √18 = 3√2, which is also calculated correctly by the assistant.\n\nThe distance from (-1, 1) to (3, 3) is √20 = 2√5, as calculated correctly by the assistant.\n\nThe assistant then correctly determines that the triangle is obtuse and identifies the shorter leg of the right triangle formed by drawing a perpendicular line from the vertex opposite the hypotenuse. \n\nThe height of the triangle is correctly calculated as 4, the difference between the x-coordinates of the two points. \n\nThe area is then correctly calculated using the base and height, giving the final answer of 4√2 square units.\n\nOverall, the assistant provides a correct and helpful answer.\n\nRating: [[9.5]]",
    "29": "The assistant's answer matches the reference answer and provides a correct solution to the problem.

The assistant's final answer of 19% is correct.\n\nRating: [[10]]",
    "31": "The assistant's answer is incorrect. The assistant incorrectly subtracted the number of unfavorable outcomes (3) from the total number of outcomes (36) to calculate the probability. However, the assistant should have subtracted the number of unfavorable outcomes (3) from the total number of outcomes where the sum is at most 2 (2 outcomes: 1-1 and 1-2) to calculate the probability.\n\nTo correct the assistant's answer, we should subtract 3 from 2 instead of 36. This gives us a total of 33 favorable outcomes (outcomes where you roll a total number that is at least 3). The assistant's calculation remains the same where we divide the number of favorable outcomes (33) by the total number of outcomes (36) to determine the probability.\n\nReference Answer:\nProbability = 35/36\n\nAssistant's Answer:\nProbability = 33/36\n\nRating: [[9]]",
    "32": "The correct answer is actually 38 people at the starting station.\n\nThe assistant's answer incorrectly calculates the number of people who boarded the bus between the first and second stations. It mistakenly assumes that 27 people got on the bus or did not get off after the second station, which is not accurate. The assistant then divides this number by 2 to get 13.5 people, but correctly states that people cannot be divided, so it rounds down to 13 people. However, it incorrectly adds 4 to this number to calculate the number of people at the starting station.\n\nTo correct the answer, we can follow the given information:\n- At the first station, half of the people got off, which means that there were originally twice as many people on the bus as those who got off, totaling 2 * (4 + 6) = 20 people.\n- Since 25 people remain after the second station, this means that there were originally 25 + 6 - 8 = 23 people on the bus after the second station.\n- Therefore, there were 2 * 23 = 46 people at the starting station.\n\nRating: [[4]]",
    "33": "The reference answer correctly shows that when twice the number is divided by 4, the remainder is 0. However, the assistant's answer incorrectly states that the remainder when 2n is divided by 4 is 8.
